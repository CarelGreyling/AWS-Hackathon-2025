# Steering Document: Parameter Risk Analysis Application

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic direction and high-level objectives for developing a Parameter Risk Analysis Application that evaluates XML parameter files and provides impact risk assessments for customers.

## Project Vision

To create an intelligent analysis tool that helps customers understand the potential risks associated with modifying engine parameter configurations, enabling informed decision-making and reducing operational risks.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Risk Mitigation**: Provide customers with clear risk assessments before implementing parameter changes
- **Decision Support**: Enable data-driven decisions regarding parameter modifications
- **Operational Safety**: Reduce the likelihood of adverse impacts from parameter changes
- **Customer Confidence**: Increase trust in parameter modifications through transparent risk analysis

### Success Metrics
- Accuracy of risk predictions (target: >90%)
- Reduction in customer-reported issues post-parameter changes (target: 50%)
- User adoption rate (target: 80% of eligible customers)
- Time to risk assessment (target: <5 minutes per analysis)

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
- XML parameter file parsing and analysis
- Risk assessment algorithms and models
- User interface for risk visualization
- Historical data analysis for risk patterns
- Integration with existing customer workflows
- Reporting and audit capabilities

### Out of Scope
- Engine implementation details (treated as black-box)
- Real-time engine monitoring
- Parameter value recommendations (focus on risk assessment only)
- Direct engine parameter modification

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Customers**: End users who modify engine parameters
- **Support Teams**: Teams that assist customers with parameter changes
- **Engineering Teams**: Teams responsible for engine maintenance

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Product Management**: Strategic direction and feature prioritization
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation
- **Security Team**: Security review and compliance

## Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with organizational goals of:
- Improving customer experience through proactive risk management
- Reducing support burden through self-service risk assessment
- Enhancing product reliability and customer confidence
- Leveraging data analytics for operational insights

## High-Level Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Requirements gathering and design
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-6): Core development and testing
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 7-8): Integration and user acceptance testing
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 9-10): Deployment and monitoring

## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition
- Technical Lead (1)
- Backend Developers (2)
- Frontend Developer (1)
- QA Engineer (1)
- DevOps Engineer (0.5)

### Technology Stack
- Cloud platform: AWS
- Backend: Python/Java
- Frontend: React/Vue.js
- Database: PostgreSQL/DynamoDB
- Analytics: Machine Learning services

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- Complexity of XML parsing and validation
- Accuracy of risk assessment algorithms
- Performance with large parameter files

### Business Risks
- Customer adoption challenges
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- Data privacy and security concerns

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:
1. Risk assessment accuracy meets or exceeds 90%
2. User interface provides clear, actionable insights
3. System processes parameter files within performance targets
4. Customer feedback indicates improved confidence in parameter changes
5. Measurable reduction in parameter-related incidents

## Next Steps

1. Finalize detailed requirements specification
2. Complete technical design documentation
3. Establish development environment and CI/CD pipeline
4. Begin iterative development with regular stakeholder feedback
