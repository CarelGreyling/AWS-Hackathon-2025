## Overview
This step allows users to pick an alert and query the customers that would be impacted by changes in this alert.

## User Input Specifications

### Alert Name Requirements
- **Field Type**: Text input
- **Required**: Yes
- **Maximum Length**: 255 characters
- **Minimum Length**: 3 characters
- **Allowed Characters**: 
  - Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
  - Hyphens (-)
  - Underscores (_)
  - Spaces (converted to underscores internally)

### Validation Rules
1. **Uniqueness**: Alert name must be unique within the user's account/workspace
2. **Format**: Must start with a letter or number
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Names are case-insensitive for uniqueness checks
4. **Reserved Names**: Cannot use system reserved keywords like "default", "system", "admin"

### User Experience
- **Placeholder Text**: "Enter a descriptive name for your alert (e.g., 'High CPU Usage Alert')"
- **Real-time Validation**: Show validation feedback as user types
- **Auto-suggestions**: Suggest names based on alert type or monitored resource
- **Character Counter**: Display remaining characters (255 max)

### Error Handling
- **Empty Field**: "Alert name is required"
- **Too Short**: "Alert name must be at least 3 characters long"
- **Too Long**: "Alert name cannot exceed 255 characters"
- **Invalid Characters**: "Alert name contains invalid characters. Use only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores"
- **Duplicate Name**: "An alert with this name already exists. Please choose a different name"
- **Reserved Name**: "This name is reserved. Please choose a different name"

### Examples
**Valid Names:**
- "Production Database CPU Alert"
- "web-server-memory-warning"
- "API_Response_Time_Monitor"
- "Critical System Health Check"

**Invalid Names:**
- "Al" (too short)
- "My Alert!" (invalid character)
- "default" (reserved name)

## Backend API Integration

### Customer Impact Check
When a user enters an alert name, the system performs a real-time check to determine potential customer impact if the alert configuration is modified.

#### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/alerts/impact-analysis
```

#### Request Payload
```json
{
  "alertName": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "accountId": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

#### API Call Trigger
- **When**: Triggered after alert name validation passes
- **Debounce**: 500ms delay after user stops typing
- **Method**: Asynchronous POST request
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds maximum

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "alertExists": true,
    "impactAnalysis": {
      "customersAffected": 1250,
      "criticalServices": [
        "payment-processing",
        "user-authentication"
      ],
      "dependentAlerts": [
        "downstream-service-alert",
        "cascade-failure-alert"
      ],
      "estimatedDowntime": "2-5 minutes",
      "riskLevel": "HIGH"
    },
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider maintenance window scheduling",
      "Notify affected customers in advance",
      "Prepare rollback plan"
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-12T04:15:01.152Z"
}
```

#### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "IMPACT_ANALYSIS_FAILED",
    "message": "Unable to analyze customer impact at this time",
    "details": "Service temporarily unavailable"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-12T04:15:01.152Z"
}
```

### User Interface Updates

#### Loading State
- Show spinner with text: "Analyzing potential customer impact..."
- Disable form submission during analysis

#### Impact Display
When impact data is received, display:
- **Customer Count**: "⚠️ 1,250 customers may be affected"
- **Risk Level Badge**: Color-coded (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
- **Critical Services**: Expandable list of affected services
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions in an info panel

#### Error Handling
- **API Timeout**: "Impact analysis timed out. You can proceed, but consider the potential risks."
- **API Error**: "Unable to check customer impact. Please contact support if this persists."
- **Network Error**: "Connection issue. Impact analysis unavailable."

### Implementation Notes
- Cache impact analysis results for 5 minutes to avoid redundant API calls
- Log all impact analysis requests for audit purposes
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- Consider rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## Next Steps
After successfully entering the alert name and reviewing customer impact analysis, the user can:
1. Proceed to configure alert parameters if impact is acceptable
2. Choose a different alert name if impact is too high
3. Schedule the alert change for a maintenance window
