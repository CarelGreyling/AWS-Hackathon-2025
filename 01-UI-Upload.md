# Upload Feature Specification

## Overview
This document defines the specification for a file upload feature that allows users to upload files through a web interface with support for multiple file types, progress tracking, and validation.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Upload Functionality
- **File Selection**: Users can select single or multiple files using a file picker dialog
- **Drag & Drop**: Support for drag-and-drop file upload interface
- **File Types**: Only XML files are accepted:
  - XML: .xml files with valid XML structure
  - MIME Type: application/xml or text/xml
- **File Size Limits**: 
  - Individual file: Maximum 100MB
  - Total upload session: Maximum 500MB
- **Batch Upload**: Support for uploading multiple files simultaneously (up to 10 files)

### User Interface Requirements
- **Upload Area**: Clear visual indication of upload zone with hover states
- **Progress Indicators**: 
  - Individual file progress bars
  - Overall upload progress
  - Upload speed and time remaining
- **File Preview**: XML structure preview with syntax highlighting
- **File Management**:
  - Remove files before upload
  - Retry failed uploads
  - Cancel ongoing uploads

### Validation & Error Handling
- **Pre-upload Validation**:
  - XML file extension verification (.xml)
  - MIME type validation (application/xml or text/xml)
  - XML well-formedness validation
  - File size validation
  - Duplicate file detection
- **XML-Specific Validation**:
  - XML syntax validation
  - Schema validation (if XSD provided)
  - Character encoding detection and validation
  - XML declaration verification
- **Error States**:
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Server errors (4xx, 5xx)
  - File corruption detection
  - Timeout handling
- **User Feedback**:
  - Success notifications
  - Clear error messages with resolution steps
  - Warning messages for potential issues

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Implementation
- **Framework**: React/Vue.js/Angular compatible
- **File API**: HTML5 File API for file handling
- **Upload Method**: XMLHttpRequest with progress events or Fetch API
- **Chunked Upload**: Support for large file chunking (optional)
- **Resume Capability**: Ability to resume interrupted uploads

### Backend Integration
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/upload/xml` - XML file upload
  - `POST /api/upload/xml/batch` - Multiple XML file upload
  - `GET /api/upload/status/{id}` - Upload status check
  - `POST /api/upload/xml/validate` - XML validation endpoint
- **XML Processing**: 
  - XML parser integration for validation
  - Schema validation support (XSD)
  - XML transformation capabilities (XSLT)
- **Storage**: Integration with cloud storage optimized for XML files
- **Security**: 
  - XML file structure validation on server
  - XXE (XML External Entity) attack prevention
  - XML bomb protection
  - Authentication/authorization checks

### Performance Requirements
- **Upload Speed**: Optimize for concurrent uploads
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling of large files without memory overflow
- **Bandwidth**: Adaptive upload based on connection speed
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies

## User Experience Flow

### Upload Process
1. User navigates to upload interface
2. User selects files via file picker or drag-and-drop
3. System validates files and displays preview
4. User confirms upload or makes modifications
5. Upload begins with progress indication
6. System provides real-time feedback
7. Upload completion with success/error status
8. User receives confirmation and next steps

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and descriptions
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast mode
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive text for all visual elements

## Security Considerations
- **XML Validation**: Server-side XML structure and schema validation
- **XXE Prevention**: Protection against XML External Entity attacks
- **XML Bomb Protection**: Prevention of billion laughs and other XML-based DoS attacks
- **Content Filtering**: Sanitization of XML content to prevent malicious payloads
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through upload rate limiting
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication for XML uploads
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt XML files in transit and at rest
- **Schema Enforcement**: Strict adherence to predefined XML schemas

## Success Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate**: Target 99.5% successful uploads
- **Performance**: Average upload time under 30 seconds for 10MB files
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on upload experience
- **Error Recovery**: 95% of failed uploads successfully retried

## Future Enhancements
- **XML Schema Management**: Dynamic schema upload and validation
- **XML Transformation**: Built-in XSLT transformation capabilities
- **XML Diff/Merge**: Compare and merge XML files
- **Namespace Management**: Advanced XML namespace handling
- **XML Validation Rules**: Custom validation rule engine
- **XML Preview**: Enhanced XML viewer with collapsible nodes
- **Batch Processing**: XML batch processing and transformation workflows

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Basic single file upload with progress tracking
2. **Phase 2**: Multiple file upload and drag-and-drop
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced validation and error handling
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and chunked uploads
5. **Phase 5**: Enhanced security and accessibility features
